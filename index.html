<h1>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself</h1> 
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
<li><i> If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</li></i>
<li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</li></b>
</ul>
You did it! You should be proud of yourself<br/>
